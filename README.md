# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to choose their marks and play against each other or against a computer-controlled opponent.

## Gameplay

1. When the game loads, you will see a form section where you need to choose the marks for each 2. player. Player one selects their mark from the available options, and the same goes for player two.
3. Next, choose whether player one or player two will be controlled by a human player or the computer by selecting the appropriate option.
Once you have made your selections, click the "PLAY" button.
4. The main game board will appear with a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (Argentine soccer shields) in empty cells by clicking on them.
5. The game continues until one player wins by forming a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) with their marks, or the game ends in a draw if no player wins and the board is filled.
